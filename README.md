# C# OOP Fleet Management System ðŸš—

A console application built in C# to model and manage a fleet of vehicles. This project serves as a practical demonstration of fundamental Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

## Core Concepts Demonstrated

This project was built to showcase a strong understanding of the four pillars of OOP and related software design concepts:

-   **Inheritance:** A `HybridVehicle` class inherits from a base `Vehicle` class, sharing common attributes while also having its own unique properties (like battery capacity).
-   **Polymorphism:** The application manages a `List<Vehicle>` containing both `Vehicle` and `HybridVehicle` objects, treating them uniformly through the base class interface while invoking their specific overridden methods.
-   **Encapsulation:** Each class encapsulates its own data (private fields) and exposes functionality through public methods, hiding the internal complexity.
-   **Abstraction:** The base `Vehicle` class provides an abstract representation of a vehicle, defining a contract that all vehicle types must follow.
-   **Data Structures:** Utilizes the `List<T>` collection to efficiently store and iterate over the collection of vehicle objects.

## Features

-   Defines a clear class structure for different vehicle types.
-   Instantiates and manages a collection of diverse vehicles in a single list.
-   Calculates operational data for each vehicle, such as maximum travel range and trip feasibility.
-   Overrides the `ToString()` method to provide a clean, readable summary of each vehicle's status.
